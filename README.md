# image-to-ascii

This is a small Python script that takes in an image file and prints it to the terminal using ASCII characters. It only took me
about 30 minutes to make, but it's pretty fun to mess around with different images.

The code in this repository uses Gudetama as an example!

### Before
![Normal Gudetama]('./gudetama.jpeg')

### After
![ASCII Gudetama]('./gudetama-ascii.jpg')
